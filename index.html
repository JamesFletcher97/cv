  <h3>Education</h3>
  <p>During my first two years at MMU, I learnt the fundamental skills in the creation of digital assets in both 2D and 3D environments for the output of computer-generated imaging across different platforms. I developed these skills in a number of
    areas, including 3D modelling and advanced compositing and its role within the VFX pipeline.</p>
  <p>In my final year, I had the opportunity to develop advanced animations and visual effects in both individual and collaborative projects. I embarked on a self-directed final project, bringing together the knowledge and skills I had obtained to
    create a centrepiece for my degree portfolio.</p>
